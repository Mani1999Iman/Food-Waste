==================
## What this project does
The project contains a quiz that teaches users more about food waste. It also contains further information about food waste.
## Why this project is useful
It helps educate people about this issue in a more fun way.
## How we built this 
I built this using HTML and CSS, though it's not the most effecient way of creating a quiz, this was the best design I could do given my limited coding knowledge.
## Accomplishments that we are proud of 
I am very proud of the whole quiz, at first I was not sure if it would work properly but I think it works well. I am also very glad I was able to carry this out.
## What is next for this project
Proper back end code that helps the website run. Back end code would also allow for a user system for a food waste tracker that I had hoped to add to this website.
